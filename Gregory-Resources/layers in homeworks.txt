If the client is standalone then you
need a separate library project for the Interface,
and Entities, and Exceptions used by the Interface.

>> Structure 2
If client is JSP/JSF/Servlet or Enterprise client
then you put Bean, Bean Interface, Entities,

And then -war project has dependency on -ejb.

Everything is in a -war project.
