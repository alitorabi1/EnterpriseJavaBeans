* Prospecting and networking

* Set a small web site, get basic cheap business cards

* Be prepared for 'fat and famin' cycle initially

* Ideally you will acquire 3 repeat customers over time

* Make sure you charge for preparation to the project 10-20%

* Do NOT work with customers that have no money
to pay you but offer majority of the payment
after the project "sells" or "succeds"

* Everything is negotiable

* In a contract you must include:
- disclaimer of no responsibility for use of the software,
damages cause directly or indirectly by the software
- give customer time to test and come back with list
of issues to correct but put a time limit on it, e.g. 30 days.
- put a clear dealine of when payments for your time
must be made, e.g. invoice every 20 hours or 2 weeks,
whichever comes sooner, payment within 10 business days.
- contract will include the amount of hours that it will
take to develop the project up to certain stage.
AND you must include a clause for "additional hours".

* Generally, if you're working for a software company,
you will transfer all your rights to code you created
to them.

* If you expect to use the code for another customer
then you may get a license from your current customer
to use it in your future consulitng / software-dev project.
(Customer is licensing the software back to you)

* If the customer is not software type of business
(e.g. building a website for someone) then do NOT
assign the IP (copyright) but instead license it to them.

* Rule of thumb about price per hour.
Take hourly rate of full time employee (e.g. $30/hour)
and double that (e.g. 2*$30 is $60/hour)
Ask that rate, if it's too much they will tell you.
Initially for the first 1-3 contracts you may ask less.

* Last payment issues - do not deliver final,
corrected version until they deliver the last payment

* Until you're making 30,000CAD in any 4 consecutive
quarter you do NOT need to register (or collect) GST/QST.
(check current rules on Revenu Quebec website)

Recommend: do NOT register for GST/QST until you have to.

* Start with BENEFITS for the customer, NOT the features.

* Break project down into a few deliverables / milestons
with a timeline and what features they will have.

* First 1 hour of discussion (at their office is free).
WARNING: Do NOT solve all their probles, do NOT give them
solutions, instead ask questions, focus on what their
issues and goals are with this project.
